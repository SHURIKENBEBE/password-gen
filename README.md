## WHEN prompted for password criteria
## THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
## WHEN prompted for the length of the password
## THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
## WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
## THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
## WHEN I answer each prompt
## THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
## WHEN all prompts are answered
## THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
